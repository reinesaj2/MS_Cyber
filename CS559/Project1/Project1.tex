\section{Introduction}
This document reports on the setup of the required virtual environments for the CS559 course. The environments include a virtualization software, and both Kali and Ubuntu virtual machines (VMs).

\section{Virtualization Software Setup}
The virtualization software was successfully installed and configured as per the guidelines provided in Section 1.2.2 of the project instructions.
