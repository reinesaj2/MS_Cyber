    Project Report:
    ---------------
    1. Generation of Random Numbers:
       - A function was developed to generate a list of 1000 random numbers.
       - The random number generator is seeded with a changing value each time the program runs.

    2. Sorting Algorithms:
       - Implemented two sorting algorithms: Selection Sort and Insertion Sort.
       - Both algorithms record the number of key comparisons and swaps made during the sorting process.
       - The sorted list and the metrics are displayed at the end of each sort.

    3. Searching Algorithm:
       - Developed a recursive binary search algorithm.
       - The function prompts the user to enter a number to search in the sorted list.
       - It finds the first occurrence of the number and displays the number of comparisons made.
       - The search loop terminates when the user enters "0".

    4. Main Program:
       - The user specifies the number of times the algorithms should run.
       - The program loops for the specified number of times, generating random numbers, sorting them, and collecting data.
       - The total number of key comparisons and swaps are displayed for each sorting method.
       - The search function is called to allow the user to perform searches in the sorted list.
       - The program displays the author's name and terminates upon completion.

    5. Documentation and Comments:
       - Abundant comments have been added to explain the code.
       - Python triple-quote formatting was used for comments, as per the guidelines provided.

    Thank you for using this program!
