# CS610 Project 1: QKD-Encrypted LLM for Secure Local Use

## Project Overview
This project implements a secure client-server architecture using a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) deployed on the `stu.cs.jmu.edu` server. The project demonstrates advanced cryptographic techniques by simulating Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to encrypt communications between the client and server.

## Files and Structure
- **server.py**: Hosts the GPT-2 model using Flask and provides an API endpoint for text generation.
- **client.py**: A client script that simulates QKD, encrypts a message, sends it to the server, and decrypts the server's response.
- **qkd.py**: Contains functions to simulate the QKD process and encrypt/decrypt messages using XOR.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
- **README.md**: This document, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Ensure you have access to the `stu.cs.jmu.edu` server and clone the project files or upload them using Cyberduck.

### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv QKD
source QKD/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Server
On the `stu.cs.jmu.edu` server, navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
python server.py
```

### 5. Run the Client
On your local machine or another device:
```bash
python client.py
```

## How It Works
1. **QKD Simulation**: The `client.py` script simulates a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) process to securely exchange a key with the server.
2. **Message Encryption**: The message is encrypted using XOR with the QKD key and sent to the server.
3. **Server Response**: The server processes the request using the GPT-2 model and sends an encrypted response back to the client.
4. **Decryption**: The client decrypts the server's response using the same QKD key.

## Known Issues
- The QKD simulation is basic and serves an educational purpose rather than fully replicating quantum communication.
- There may be slight delays in processing due to encryption and decryption steps.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the integration of modern cryptographic techniques with machine learning, ensuring secure communication in a client-server environment.
